In this post we will install plasma desktop on debian and arch based systems (termux) and configure them to work with x11 and vnc servers. 

# Pre-requisites:

2. Run the following command:

```
apt update && apt install plasma-desktop dbus-x11

```
echo "rm /run/dbus/pid 

dbus-daemon --system 

DISPLAY=:1 dbus-launch startplasma-x11" >> /usr/local/bin/vncstart && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/plasma-start

```
4. Now create a new session in termux and type the following command:

```
pkg install x11-repo && pkg install tigervnc xorg-xhost -y && vncserver :1 && DISPLAY=:1 xhost +

```

5. Go back to debian terminal and type "plasma-start" to start your plasma desktop.

6. Open vnc viewer and connect to localhost:1 to view your desktop.
